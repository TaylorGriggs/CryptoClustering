# CryptoClustering

## Background
In this challenge we are using Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Requirements
1) Find the Best Value for k by Using the Original Data
2) Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-Means by Using the Original Data
3) Optimize the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
4) Find the Best Value for k by Using the PCA Data
5) Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means by Using the PCA Data
6) Visualize and Compare the Results

## Results
### K Value Determination

## Conclusion
I was able to decipher which grouping lead to a more compelling story in machine learning and ultimately Principle Componant Analysis was the correct method witha K of 4
